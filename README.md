# Revelio

The Spread of fake media generated by advanced AI techniques in recent years has been a serious problem in our societies. The tremendous progress of deep learning techniques made it easy to generate quite realistic fake media.
Our main objective is to detect and prevent the spread of fake videos that can be used in news, adult content, financial fraud, blackmailing, politics, and more.
We use various Image Processing and Machine Learning techniques to determine whether the person in the video is authentic or manipulated.
Our system analyzes the video through four main techniques which tackle different abnormalities found in manipulated videos which are: Lips movements analysis, Dynamic Texture analysis, Frequency domain analysis, and finally Self Blending images technique.
Our system manages to detect fake videos with an accuracy at least 95%, with providing different analysis insights including the type of manipulation that may have been used.
We provide an easy-to-use website for users to submit their videos for analysis and API to be integrated with various platforms.
